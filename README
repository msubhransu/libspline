LIBSPLINE is a library for training smooth additive classifiers based on splines (and other representations)

It implements a slight modification of GLASS [3] for the classification setting, as well as two embeddings 
based on Fourier basis (Trigonometric and Hermite). The solver is based on LIBLINEAR's dual coordinate 
descend algorithm. Features are computed online to minimize memory overhead during training.

COMPILING:

On UNIX/OSX - modify the MATLAB path in the Makefile and run "make"
On Windows - run the make.m


USAGE:
The library is interfaced with MATLAB and provides three functions: 
train 	: trains additive classifiers
predict : predicts labels using trained models
encode 	: encode features x -> \Phi(x), such that the decision function is w'\Phi(x). 
	  These can be used directly with linear solvers such as LIBLINEAR.


Usage: model = train(training_label_vector, training_instance_matrix, 'options', 'col');
options:
-t type     : 0: Spline, 1: Trigonometric, 2: Hermite  (default=0)
-d degree   : set the B-Spline degree (default=1) d={0,1,2,3}
-r reg      : set the order of regularization (default=1) r={0,1,2,...}
-n bins     : set the number of bins (default 10)
-c cost     : set the parameter C (default 1)
-e epsilon  : set tolerance of termination criterion
		       Dual maximal violation <= eps; similar to libsvm (default 0.1)
-B bias     : if bias >= 0, instance x becomes [x; bias]; if < 0, no bias term added (default 1)
-wi weight  : weights adjust the parameter C of different classes (see README for details)
col:
	if 'col' is set, training_instance_matrix is parsed in column format, otherwise is in row format


Usage: [predicted_label,accuracy,decision_values] = predict(test_label_vector, test_instance_matrix, model, 'col');
options:
	if 'col' is set, test_instance_matrix is parsed in column format, otherwise is in row format

Usage: [encodedFeats, model] = encode(feats, [model or 'options'], 'col');
outputs:
encodedFeats	: encoded features (Note, these are in 'col' format) 
model		: if options are provided instead of a model, then returns a model

options:
-t type		: O: Spline, 1: Trigonometric, 2: Hermite (default=0, t={0,1,2} )
-d degree	: set the degree of B-Spline basis (default=1, d={0,1,2,3} )
-r reg		: set the order of regularization (default=1) r={0,1,2,...}
-n bins		: set the number of bins (default 10)
