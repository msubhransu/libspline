LIBSPLINE is a library for training additive classifiers based on B-splines. 

Usage: 

model = splinetrain(training_label_vector, training_instance_matrix, 'options', 'col');\n"
	"options:\n"
	"-d degree   : set the degree of B-Spline basis (default=1, d={0=constant,1=linear,2=quadratic,3=cubic} )\n"
	"-r reg      : set the order of regularization (default=1) r={0,1,2,...}\n"
	"-n bins     : set the number of bins (default 10)\n"
	"-c cost     : set the parameter C (default 1)\n"
	"-e epsilon  : set tolerance of termination criterion\n"
	"		       Dual maximal violation <= eps; similar to libsvm (default 0.1)\n"
	"-B bias     : if bias >= 0, instance x becomes [x; bias]; if < 0, no bias term added (default 1)\n"
	"-wi weight  : weights adjust the parameter C of different classes (see README for details)\n"
	"col:\n"
	"	if 'col' is set, training_instance_matrix is parsed in column format, otherwise is in row format\n"


Details:

-d degree : specifies the degree of uniformly spaced B-spline basis (d=0,1,2,3 are supported, corresponding to 
			constant, linear, quadratic and cubic B-spline basis. 
-r reg    : Regularization based on a difference matrix of order r. r=0 corresponds to identity matrix, r=1 
			corresponds to a first order difference matrix, and r=2 is the second order (D1^2), and so on. 
			Recommended values of r are 0,1,2.

The rest of the options are based on LIBLINEAR's dual coordinate descent algorithm. See LIBLINEAR for more details.
